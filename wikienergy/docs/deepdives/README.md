###Goals

####Disaggregation

- Existence
- Modeling Appliances
- Labeling States
- Extracting Signal

###Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

-  Develop appliance instance parameters using hidden markov models
    *   z<sub>t</sub>(discrete variable) corresponds to one of K states
(state1=on, state2=off)
    *   x<sub>t</sub> (continous variable) is amount of power > 0 (e.x. 100 W)
    *   Hidden Markov Parameters:
        *   Initial Probabilities (&alpha;)
        *   Transition matrix (C) (probability of transition between hidden
states)
        *   Emission variables (&phi;) â€“ Gaussian-Gamma, hyperparameters:
            *   mean, precision, shape, scale
        *   Observed Data (power values, other features)
        *   Hidden States (ON or OFF)
    *  Can be used to generate sample data, predict states, evaluate likelihood
    *  Often used for modeling probabalistic temporal processes
    *  Limited ability to model periodic signals

###Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM)
*  combines several hidden markov models in parallel
*   state space comprises all possible combinations of appliance states

###Neural Networks
* Used for semi-supervised and supervised learning
* Good for modeling non-linear functions
* Mimics biological neurons
* Multiple layers of neurons
* Each neuron applies a sigmoidal function to the weighted sum of the
activations of its input neurons

##Analysis
###Most Common Appliances in Homes
* Ask for suggestions

###Percent HVAC
Historically, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning have consumed over
half of all home energy. Nationwide the fraction of energy consumed by HVAC
has gone down from 58% in 1993 to 48% in 2009, but the number is still large.
In intense climates the percent used by HVAC can be even larger, in research
done by Pecan Street HVAC demanded 82% of the energy of some homes.
Here is what we found:

<img src="../../assets/images/Percent_Hvac_10.png" width=33% alt = "October">


###Weather
* Sanity check for Heat and AC use, by looking at correlation
* Created an API which returns minute interval weather data(temp) by zip code
    * This allows us to embed weather information in future models 

####Usage
Use `get_weather_data(api_key,city,state,start_date,end_date)` to query historical weather data. The function will return a JSON object. To query live weather data, use `get_current_temp(city,state, zipcode = None)`.

###EV
After speaking with Pecan Street we learned that there is need for a way to reliably classify an electric vehicle opposed to another large load, such as HVAC. We've started exploring the homes with EV data looking for the signatures of these cars.
