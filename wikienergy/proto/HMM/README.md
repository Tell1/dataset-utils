Prototyping notebooks for HMM
=============================
- hmm\_appliance: This is an exploratory notebook hwere we opened some Tracebase data that had been stored in JSON Files (using notebooks in the createJSON folder).

- hmm\_from\_scratch: This is a notebook that manually generates an HMM based on parameters to be used for prediction using the Viterbi algorithm.

- hmm\_implementation: This notebook takes tracebase data and iterates through the different instances of an appliance type, looking for the best model. It then predicts with this best model on test data from tracebase.
