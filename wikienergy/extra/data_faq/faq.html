            <hr/>
            <h3>Why do you need to see my energy usage data?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
One of the primary ways we would like to help you save energy is by "disaggregating" electric meter data. By disaggregating this data, we can estimate the energy used by different appliances in the household without having to directly measure them. With this information you will be able to reduce both your energy demand and your energy bill.  For example, some have learned that their air conditioning units use hundreds of times more energy than their lights. With data at your fingertips your smart meter can help you make smart decisions. Is your desktop computer on when it shouldn't be? What sort of return on investment would you have on a new refrigerator? We want to work with you, and your data, to answer these questions. 
            </p>
            <h3>How much will this cost me?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
Nothing! Actually, we want to help you take a chunk out of your energy bill. You know how high it is!
            </p>
            <h3>Who else is participating in this trial?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
Your neighbors! For now, this early trial is exclusively in Oak Park. If this program is successful in Oak Park, future programs like this around the country will benefit from what we've learned here.
            </p>
            <h3>What kind of information will you be able to see?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
We will be able to see your energy usage (kWh) in short time intervals. 
            </p>
            <h3>Will my data be kept private?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
Yes, your data will only be visible to members of Data Science for Social Good (DSSG). 
            </p>
            <h3What is DSSG? </h3>
            <p class="answer">
Data Science for Social Good is a fellowship program at the University of Chicago connecting young data scientists and non-profits. Our purpose is social good. We create open source tools that help communities, organizations, and individuals use their data intelligently for their benefit and for the benefit of others. <a href='http://dssg.uchicago.edu/'>Click here to learn more about our fellowship program.</a>

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
Just a couple of heroes interested in saving energy!
