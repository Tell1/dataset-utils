AMPds: Terms of Use
===================

Dear user,

Using AMPds requires you to cite my research paper (citation information above or use bibtex file) in your publications or presentations. I request that if you use AMPds in your publication that you provide me a copy of the publication. I request that you do not pass the username and password to access AMPds or AMPds files/archive to other researchers; they need to make a direct request to me. You cannot use AMPds for commercial reasons without express written agreement from myself. The granting of commercial use requires the purchase of a licence to do so. You agree that I make no warranties about AMPds, and disclaim liability for all uses of AMPds, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. When using or citing AMPds, you should not imply endorsement by me. I reserve the right, in my sole discretion, not to grant access to AMPds to specific requests for access. Although rare, such refusals may occur due to situations that pose a conflict of interest, for example. I also reserve the right, in my sole discretion, to change this Terms of Use Agreement at any time without prior notice.

By using AMPds, you agree to these terms.

Best regards,
Stephen Makonin
